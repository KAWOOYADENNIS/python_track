#syntax for variable names in python
# the name of a varible should not start with a number(1space or 2space)
# the name of the variable should not start with any symbol(#,@)  
# dont leave spaces with compound variable names or names with more than one word(in such a case, use _ e.g pay_as_you_earn or use carmel notion e.g payAsYouEarn)
# use relatable variable names or words(e.g salary_netincome_grossprofit)
# its recommended to start a variable name with small letters(e.g salary)
# during creation of variable name it should have a value(e.g salary=1000)
# try to use shorter variable names(e.g sal to mean salary, net to mean netpay)
# dont use special key words as variables
