OOP(object orienated programming);
is a concept of programming that advocates to create software basing on real world objects.
all objects are coming from a class.
A class is a blueprint of an object. 
NOTE: classes are written in singular. e.g class:country i.e uganda.
if you want to identify which class an object belongs, we use a phrase "Is a"
the name of a class should start with a capital letter e.g Girl:
An object is an instance of a class.

cONCEPTS IN OOP;
1. Abstraction: 
   Is the level of representation e.g. animal(more details of the animal)
   its what is used to identify classes.
2. Inheritance:
   An object can take on more than one property from different classes.
   An object can be a subclass of the main/super class. e.g toyota is a subclass of class car.
   A subclass cannot be indenpendent of the main/super class.
3. Polymorphism:
   Ability of objects to take on two or more different forms. e.g a daughter in a class of the father(she is both a student and a daughter)
4. Encupsolation:
   The ability to restrict access to some of the content of a class/object is called encupsolation.
5. overloading and overriding
